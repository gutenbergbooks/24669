<h2>GO-ING TO CHURCH.</h2>


<p>How neat and nice this lit-tle boy and his sis-ter
look, go-ing in their Sun-day clothes to church!
The lit-tle girl has, I dare say, her prayer book in
her bag, and her bro-ther has his un-der his arm.
They seem by their fa-ces, to be good chil-dren,
and ap-pear ve-ry fond of each oth-er. They
have been taught by their kind pa-rents, that it is
their du-ty to at-tend di-vine wor-ship, and pray
to God, and the lit-tle girl is point-ing out to her
broth-er the poor old wo-man on her way to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>church, and seems to be prais-ing her good-ness.</p>

<h2>PRET-TY POLL.</h2>


<p>Up-on my word, this is a ve-ry pret-ty look-ing
par-rot, and the children seem much pleas-ed with
it. I hope they ne-ver play a-ny tricks with it,
or try to tease it, for par-rots when an-gry can
bite pret-ty hard. Poll and her young friends
seem to be quite on good terms, but I should not
like to have my fin-ger so near her bill, unless I
were cer-tain of her be-ing in a good hu-mour.
Par-rots a-muse us much by their be-ing able to

<h2>THE FLOW-ER GAR-DEN.</h2>


<p>What a pret-ty scene a flow-er gar-den af-fords!
Roses, tu-lips, wall-flowers, and ma-ny oth-ers,
a-like pleasing to the sight and the smell. The
lit-tle boy de-serves to en-joy all the plea-sure
that the gar-den can pro-cure him; for he is at
work with his tools, his spade, his bar-row, and
his roll-ing stone, which shews a de-sire of mak-ing
him-self use-ful. I be-lieve, too, he has kind-ly
gi-ven his eld-est sis-ter the rose at which she
is smell-ing, and he will I have no doubt, help the
young-est in fill-ing her bas-ket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>THE NEW DOLL.</h2>


<p>We must con-fess that the lit-tle lass with the
doll in her hand, makes a ve-ry cle-ver and care-ful
nurse. She is shew-ing her new trea-sure to
her friend on her right with no small de-gree of
pride, at which we need not won-der, nor at the
man-ner in which the oth-er ap-pears to ad-mire
it, for it is a ve-ry hand-some af-fair. It must
have cost the lit-tle girl's pa-pa and ma-ma a great
deal of mo-ney, and I hope she will know how to
va-lue and take care of it, and not throw it a-bout
af-ter she has had it a lit-tle while, and get tir-ed
of it, as I have known some silly children do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>A WALK WITH MA-MA.</h2>


<p>This lit-tle boy and girl, may ve-ry well be in
high spi-rits. Their ma-ma is not of-ten a-ble to
go out with them, for the in-fant takes up a great
deal of her time, and she has ma-ny oth-er things
to at-tend to at home, so that the chil-dren most-ly
walk with the ser-vant. But to-day, ma-ma is
at lei-sure, and they have set out for a nice walk
in the fields, ba-by and all. The child-ren seem
rea-dy to skip with de-light, and e-ven Tray shares
in their joy. We wish the par-ty much pleasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h2>A RIDE WITH MA-MA.</h2>


<p>Well, this is a tru-ly sty-lish set-out. The pair
of long-tailed hor-ses are per-fect beau-ties, and
the post-lad has no need to use the whip to them.
I do not won-der that the lit-tle folks enjoy their
ride so much, in such a nice car-riage, and through
such a love-ly coun-try, and, above all as they are
a-long with their kind ma-ma, who is point-ing out
all that she thinks like-ly to a-muse them. I am
sure they have been good chil-dren, or their ma-ma
would not have ta-ken them with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>THE PET LAMB.</h2>


<p>What a pret-ty, tame, gen-tle crea-ture and
how fond-ly its young mis-tress seems to ca-ress
it. Yet I am al-most a-fraid that her kind-ness is
car-ried to ex-cess, and that she hugs the lamb
ra-ther too close for its com-fort. In-deed its
looks near-ly ex-press as much. Her bro-ther
ap-pears ful-ly to share in her fond-ness for the
lamb. He has a bas-ket of gay flowers stand-ing
on the ground be-side him, and is making a gar-land
for the neck of the pet, which when, dress-ed
out, will no doubt cut a ve-ry smart fi-gure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHARLES'S NEW <ins title="changed comma to period">BOAT.</ins></h2>


<p>Our young sail-or has just launch-ed his new
ves-sel, and a ve-ry neat and trim one it is. The
rig-ging is in good or-der, and the wind fills the
spread-ing sails brave-ly. The grace and beau-ty
of the bark seems great-ly to de-light Charles, as
well as his two sis-ters, who have come to par-take
in the plea-sure of the scene. I do not
know what car-go the ves-sel has on board, but I
think there is not much dan-ger of her be-ing
wreck-ed, as she is not like-ly to sail far out of
her mas-ter's care and sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>KIND-NESS TO THE POOR.</h2>


<p>What a plea-sure it is to see chil-dren with
good and kind hearts. How the sweet lit-tle girl
ap-pears to pi-ty the poor in-firm old wo-man to
whom she is giv-ing her pen-ny, and so does her
broth-er who has be-fore giv-en his share of re-lief.
And their good ma-ma stands look-ing on with
de-light, as she may well do, at the con-duct of
her off-spring. If we did but re-flect on the com-forts
which God al-lows us to en-joy, while so
ma-ny poor crea-tures are in want and sick-ness
and sor-row, we should al-ways be glad to shew
our-selves grate-ful to him by help-ing those who
are in dis-tress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PET DOG.</h2>


<p>Stand up, Pom-pey! You are on-ly half a
sol-di-er yet. You have got your gun in your
hand, but we must put your hel-met on be-sides
to make you com-plete. Poor Pom-pey! he is
as peace-ful and quiet as a lamb, and willing to do
a-ny thing that he can which he is told to do.
The chil-dren round him seem kind and fond of
him, and I trust they will not keep him stand-ing
long, be-cause, though it may a-muse them to see
him play a trick or two, this pos-ture is not easy
to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE ROCK-ING HORSE.</h2>


<p>This is a fa-mous dash-ing steed, and he ap-pears
to have a ve-ry smart, ac-tive young ri-der.
He has a firm and grace-ful seat, and has his reins
well in hand. He rides too with a great deal of
cou-rage, al-though we must ad-mit that his charg-er
is not like-ly to swerve from the course which
he wish-es him to keep, nor, though go-ing at full
gal-lop, is there any dan-ger of his be-ing thrown
or run a-way with by the do-cile crea-ture on
which he is mount-ed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE POOR BLACK.</h2>


<p>In some parts of the world, where the sun is
ve-ry hot, the skins of the peo-ple, in-stead of
be-ing white, like ours, are quite black; these
folks are call-ed ne-groes. Some wick-ed men
take them from their homes, and make them slaves
and ill-treat them; and ma-ny sil-ly chil-dren are
a-fraid of them, be-cause they seem ugly. I am
glad to see that our young friends have been taught
bet-ter. They are look-ing with pi-ty at the poor
black man, and the lit-tle one is giv-ing him some
re-lief. They know that God made all men of all
col-ours, and that we are all e-qual be-fore him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>THE NEW SHOES.</h2>


<p>Yes, baby is smart in-deed now. How proud
she is of her new shoes, and how ea-ger she is to
put out her lit-tle feet to shew them to her bro-ther
and sis-ter, who seem scarce-ly less pleas-ed than
her-self. Her ma-ma too looks with de-light up-on
the plea-sure her ba-by feels, and for-gets all
the trou-ble she her-self has had. I do not know
how chil-dren can be grate-ful e-nough to their
kind parents who thus pro-vide for all their
wants and plea-sures in their help-less age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE BRO-KEN DOLL.</h2>


<p>Here is a sad piece of mis-chief, and, if I am
right in my guess, Mad-am Puss, by the man-ner
in which she is scud-ding out of the room is the
au-thor of it. I sus-pect that, while the doll was
ly-ing upon the stool, the cat be-gan to play with
its long clothes, till she pull-ed it down on the
floor, where it got broken as we see. Care might
have spar-ed this loss. If the lit-tle girl, be-fore
go-ing to her mu-sic, had put the doll in a high
place out of puss's reach, all would have been
safe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h2>CLE-VER CHARLES AND STEA-DY JANE.</h2>


<p>This is a sight worth look-ing at. No one i-dle
but all mak-ing some good use of their time.
Ma-ma is sett-ing a good pat-tern. She is bu-sy
in read-ing while lit-tle Jane is work-ing close-ly
at her needle, and her el-der bro-ther Charles is
tak-ing on the Globe the mea-sure of the dis-tance
be-tween two pla-ces. Their ma-ma must
feel much plea-sure in see-ing her chil-dren em-ploy
them-selves so well, and af-ter their work is
o-ver, they will en-joy their play, when they go
to it, more than la-zy folks can ever do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE MORN-ING LES-SON.</h2>


<p>We need not ask wheth-er these two chil-dren
have learn-ed their morn-ing les-son as they ought.
<ins title="changed 'their' to 'Their'">Their</ins> own smil-ing fa-ces, and the pleas-ed looks
of their pa-pa are quite e-nough to tell us that
they are go-ing through their la-bours in a pro-per
man-ner, and not like some lit-tle folks that stop,
and blun-der, and stam-mer, and are al-ways
want-ing to be told. Their pa-pa will I dare say
re-ward them with his praise, and, ve-ry like-ly,
by tak-ing them out with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
